# Project Plan: Web-Based Drum Machine

This document outlines the development plan for our project.

## Core Concept

A web-based drum machine with a dynamic grid interface. Users can create drum loops by clicking on the grid, control playback, tempo, and the number of steps in the loop.

## Core Features

1.  **Dynamic Grid Interface:**
    *   **Rows for Sounds:** Kick, Snare, Hi-Hat, Crash, Toms, Clap.
    *   **Dynamic Columns:** The number of columns (steps) will be controlled by a slider (e.g., from 4 to 32).
    *   The grid will be visually updated when the number of steps changes.

2.  **Interactive Controls:**
    *   **Grid Cells:** Click to activate/deactivate a sound.
    *   **Playback:** A "Play/Stop" button.
    *   **Tempo:** A slider to control the speed (BPM).
    *   **Steps:** A slider to set the number of steps in the loop.
    *   **Master Volume:** A slider to control the overall output volume.
    *   **Clear Button:** A button to reset the entire grid.
    *   **Visual Feedback:** Display the current numerical value for Tempo and Steps sliders.

3.  **Audio Playback:**
    *   A visual indicator (playhead) will sweep across the grid columns.
    *   Plays all active sounds in the current column using the Web Audio API for precise timing.

## Visual Style

*   **Theme:** Clean, modern, dark-mode theme.
*   **Grid:**
    *   Inactive Cells: Muted, dark gray squares.
    *   Active Cells: Bright, glowing color (e.g., electric blue or pink).
    *   Playhead: A sweeping highlight bar.
*   **Controls:** Modern, sleek sliders and buttons with clear hover/active states.
*   **Layout:** Centered, organized layout using CSS Grid/Flexbox.
*   **Typography:** Simple, readable sans-serif font.

## Technology Stack

*   **HTML:** For the page structure.
*   **CSS:** For the dark-mode styling and layout.
*   **JavaScript:** For all logic, using the **Web Audio API**.

## Assets

*   Audio files (.wav or .mp3) for the 6 drum sounds: Kick, Snare, Hi-Hat, Crash, Toms, Clap. We will need to source these.
