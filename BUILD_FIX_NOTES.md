# Drum Machine Build Configuration Fix

## Problem Identified
The project had a configuration conflict:
- **Mixed vanilla HTML/CSS/JS and React files** causing conflicts
- **Lovable Visual Edit reverting to cached vanilla version**
- This caused style reversions and layout breaks when Lovable processed changes

## Solution Applied
1. **Converted to full React implementation** - Created proper React components
2. **Removed conflicting vanilla files** - Deleted script.js and cleaned up conflicts
3. **Updated vite.config.js** - Proper React + Lovable configuration
4. **Fixed grid layout** - Ensured React component structure matches CSS expectations

## Configuration Status
- ✅ Full React implementation with proper component structure
- ✅ Vite configured for React with lovable-tagger
- ✅ Grid layout fixed to match original CSS design
- ✅ All vanilla JS conflicts removed
- ✅ Build process optimized for Lovable's Visual Edit mode

## Prevention
The configuration is now a clean React setup that works seamlessly with Lovable's Visual Edit functionality.
