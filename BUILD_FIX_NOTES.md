# Drum Machine Build Configuration Fix

## Problem Identified
The project had a configuration conflict:
- **Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS drum machine** (actual project)
- **Vite + React build setup** (conflicting configuration)
- This caused style reversions when Lovable processed changes

## Solution Applied
1. **Simplified vite.config.js** - Removed React plugins, kept vanilla setup
2. **Removed conflicting dependencies** - Removed React and lovable-tagger
3. **Maintained dual server support** - Both `npm run dev` (Vite) and `npm start` (Express) work

## Configuration Status
- ✅ Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS optimized
- ✅ Vite serves files correctly without React processing
- ✅ Express server still works for alternative serving
- ✅ Build process won't interfere with CSS changes

## Prevention
The configuration is now aligned with the actual project type, preventing future reversions when editing in Lovable.
