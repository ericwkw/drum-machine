# Visual Edit Reversion Issue - Resolution Plan

## Issue Summary

The previous "bulletproof" solution, while attempting to fix visual editor compatibility, was overly complex, brittle, and used non-standard React practices. This created a maintenance challenge and did not fully resolve the root issues.

## Resolution: A Cleaner, More Robust Architecture

This update implements a simplified, more idiomatic React architecture that is both stable and easy to maintain. The new approach resolves the visual editor issues by adhering to standard React patterns and best practices.

### 1. Corrected `package.json`

-   Removed the incorrect `"main": "script.js"` entry.
-   Set `"type": "module"` to align with modern JavaScript standards.

### 2. Simplified and Stabilized React Component (`App.jsx`)

-   **Removed the "Bulletproof" System:** The complex `useEffect` hook with its multiple timeouts, MutationObserver, and direct DOM manipulation has been completely removed.
-   **State-Driven CSS:** The grid layout is now controlled by a CSS variable (`--steps`) that is updated via React state. This is a standard, predictable, and efficient way to manage dynamic styling.
-   **Cleaned Up State Management:** The component's state is now more organized and easier to follow.

### 3. Modern CSS Architecture (`App.css`)

-   **Dynamic Grid Layout:** The CSS now uses `grid-template-columns: repeat(var(--steps), 1fr);` to create the grid, making it fully dynamic and controlled by the `--steps` variable.
-   **Simplified Styles:** The CSS has been streamlined to match the new component structure, making it more readable and maintainable.

### 4. Improved Build Configuration

-   The `vite.config.js` remains configured for a standard React project, ensuring a smooth and predictable build process.

## Verification and Testing

The new architecture has been tested to ensure:

-   The drum machine is fully functional.
-   The UI is stable and does not revert when using visual editing tools.
-   The code is easier to understand, maintain, and extend.

This new implementation provides a solid foundation for future development and ensures a more reliable and predictable user experience.
